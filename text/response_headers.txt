---------------------------- Response Headers ---------------------------------
    
    When it comes to webscraping, response headers provide important information
for connection functionality and efficiency though we rarely need to work with
reponse headers in basic web scraping.
    
    The most notable response header in web scraping is the Set-Cookie header 
which asks our client to save some cookies for future requests. Cookies can be 
vital for website functionality so it's important to manage the when web scraping
But we usualy do not have to worry about it, becouse most of the HTTP clients 
manage cookies automatically for us.
    
    The X- prefixed headers are costum headers set by the website which can con-
tain extra response details or secret tokens.

    Finally, there are cache-related headers that are useful for scraper optimi-
zation:
        * Etag header often indicates content hash of the response letting the 
        scrapper know if the content has change since the last scrape.
        
        *Last-Modified header tells when was the last time page changed it's con-
        tent.
