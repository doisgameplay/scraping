                            REQUESTS HEADERS
                            
        While it might appear like request headers are just minor metadata 
    details, in web scraping they are extremely important.
    
        Headers contain essential details about te request - who's requesting
    the data? What type of data they are expecting? Using wrong or incomplete 
    headers might result in a error or even get the web scraper blocked
    
    
                        ----- User-Agent -----
        
        This is the client's identity header. It tells the server what type of 
    client is making the request: is it a desktop web browser? or a phone app?
        Whenever you visit a web page in your web browser it identifies itself 
    with a User-Agent string that looks something like "Browser Name, Operating 
    System, Some version numbers".
    
                        ----- Cookie -----
       
        Cookies are used to store persistent data. This is a vital feature for
    websites to keep track of user state: user logins, configuration preferences 
    etc. All of the cookie information is exchanged through this Cookie header.
    
                        ----- Accept -----
        Accept headers (also Accept-encoding, Accept-Language etc.) contain in-
    formation about what sort of content the client is expecting to receive.
        Generelly, when web scraping we wnat to mimic this one of the popular 
    web browsers.
    
                        ----- X- Prefixed Headers----
        These headers are special custom headers that could mean anything. The-
    se are important to keep an eye on when web scraping, as they migth confi-
    gure important functionality of the website/webapp
