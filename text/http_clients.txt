--------------------------- HTTP CLIENTS IN PYTHON ------------------------

	Before we start exploring HTTP connections in python, we nned to choose an HTTP client. Let's take a look at what is the best web scraping library in Python when it comes to handling HTTP connections.
	
	Python comes with an HTTP client built-on called urlib though,it's not very good for web scraping. Fortunately, the community offers several great alternatives:
	*httpx (recommended) - most feature rich client, offering http2 support and asynchronous client.
	
	*requests - most popular client and server
	
	*aiohttp - very fast asynchronous client and server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	There are three popular versions of http used in the web:


	*HTTP1.1 The most simple text based protocol used widely by simpler
	programs. Implemented by urlib. requests, httpx, aiohttp;
	
	*HTTP2 more complex/efficient binary based protocol, mostrly used by 
	web-browsers. Implemented by httpx;

	*HTTP3/QUIC the newest and most efficient version of protocol mostly
	used by web-browser. Implemented by aioquic and httpx.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	When it comes to web scraping HTTP1.1 is good enough for most cases,
	though HTTP2/3 are very helpful for avoiding web scraper blocking as 
	most of the real web users use HTTP2+ web browsers.
